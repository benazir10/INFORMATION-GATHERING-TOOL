# INFORMATION-GATHERING-TOOL
Internship Project 1Stop

INTRODUCTION:

**	The "Information Gathering Tool" is an innovative Python script developed for cybersecurity purposes, serving as an internship project assigned by 1Stop. 

** The tool offers a straightforward yet powerful method to gather essential information about a specified URL. 

** This project leverages various Python modules and taps into external services to retrieve and present critical details about the target website.

** This tool is a product of an internship project assigned by 1Stop, showcasing practical application and skill development in the field of cybersecurity. 

** It reflects a commitment to learning and contributing to the cybersecurity landscape.

**	The tool aims to provide cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers with a quick and convenient way to collect essential details about a target website.

 USE CASES:
 
**	Reconnaissance:

*	Obtain HTTP headers: The tool retrieves and displays the headers of the HTTP response, offering insights into the web server configuration and potential security headers.
*	
*	DNS information: Perform a DNS lookup to obtain the IP address associated with the provided URL, laying the groundwork for further analysis.
  
**	IP Geolocation:

*	Retrieve geographical information: Query an external service to obtain the geolocation details of the obtained IP address, including the location, region, city, and country.

**	Vulnerability Assessment:

* SSL/TLS information: Check the SSL/TLS certificate details to assess the security of the website and identify potential vulnerabilities related to encryption.
*	Port scanning (potential future enhancement): Identify open ports on the target system, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and services running on the server.

** Domain Information:

*	Whois lookup (potential future enhancement): Fetch domain registration details, including the registrar, registration date, and contact information. This aids in understanding the ownership of the domain.
  
**	Subdomain Enumeration (potential future enhancement):

*	Discover additional subdomains associated with the target domain. Subdomains may host different services and applications that could be potential targets.
  
**	Technology Stack Identification (potential future enhancement):
 	
* Identify the technology stack used by the target website, such as web server information, content management systems (CMS), and other technologies. This information can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities associated with specific software versions.
